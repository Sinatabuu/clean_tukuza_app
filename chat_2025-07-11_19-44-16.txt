Jesus, also known as Jesus Christ, is the central figure of Christianity and is believed by Christians to be the Son of God and the savior of humanity. According to Christian teachings, Jesus was born around 4-6 BC in Bethlehem and spent his early years in Nazareth. He began his public ministry around the age of 30, preaching about love, forgiveness, and salvation.

Jesus performed miracles, taught in parables, and challenged the religious authorities of his time. He was ultimately arrested, crucified, and died on a cross as a sacrifice for the sins of humanity. Christians believe that Jesus rose from the dead three days later, demonstrating his victory over sin and death.

Jesus' teachings of love, compassion, and forgiveness continue to inspire billions of people around the world. He is viewed as a spiritual leader, moral exemplar, and ultimately, the one who offers salvation and eternal life to all who believe in him.
